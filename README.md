# Styles

Hungry Human is a variable font with two axes:
Width (wdth): 90 – 450
Slant (slnt): -40 – 40

The default width is 90 with a slant of 0.
This produces an interval that can be divided on a 3x5 grid.
Each interval of 30 adds another integer to the width of the grid and stops at 450.
For example, a width of 150 is a 5x5 grid since 30 × 5 = 150.

The slant value indicates the number of degrees you want the type to slant.

Different grid widths can be combined to produce interesting effects.
For example, setting all uppercase characters to 4x5 and all lowercase to 3x5 makes everything look more square.
